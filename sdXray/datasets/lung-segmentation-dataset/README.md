**Database**

**Description:** The standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is
created by the National Library of Medicine in collaboration with the
Department of Health and Human Services, Montgomery County, Maryland,
USA. The set contains data from X­‐rays collected under Montgomery
County\`s Tuberculosis screening program.

Number of X­‐rays:

> ­‐ 58 cases with manifestation of tuberculosis, and ­‐ 80 normal cases.

Image parameters:

> ­‐ Format: PNG
>
> ­‐ Matrix size is 4020 x 4892, or 4892 x 4020.
>
> ­‐ The pixel spacing in vertical and horizontal directions is 0.0875
> mm. ­‐ Number of gray levels is 12bits.

Image file names are coded as MCUCXR\_#####\_0/1.png,where '0'
represents the normal and '1' represents the abnormal lung.

**Lung** **Annotations**

We manually generated the "gold standard" segmentations for the chest
X­‐ray under the supervision of a radiologist. We used the following
conventions for outlining the lung boundaries: Both posterior and
anterior ribs are readily visible in the CXRs; the part of the lung
behind the heart is excluded. We follow anatomical landmarks such as the
boundary of the hearth, aortic arc/line, and pericardium line; and sharp
costophrenic angle that follow the diaphragm boundary. We draw an
inferred boundary when the pathology is severe and affects the
morphological appearance of the lungs.

**IRB** **Details:** The dataset were de­‐identified by the data
providers and were exempted from IRB review at their institutions. The
data set use and public release were exempted from IRB review (No. 5357)
by the NIH Office of Human Research Projections Programs.
